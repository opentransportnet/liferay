						The Hubs are a popular resource in the transport industry for a
						number of reasons:
						<ul>
							<li>Firstly, the Hubs pull together, harmonize, link and
								visualize open data including Geospatial Information (GI) from
								across Europe, including major public datasets such as INSPIRE and
								Copernicus (Earth Observation) data, real-time sensor data and
								citizen-volunteered information such as Open Street Map, to
								provide the most comprehensive data-mapping infrastructure
								available for the industry, scientists, public servants or
								citizens. Users can simply chose the geographical locations of
								the data sets they wish to experiment with. Similarly, new
								cities can easily create a hub in their local area and join the
								growing network of providers with a few clicks.</li>
							<li>Secondly, the user-friendly interface and intuitive data
								tools, enhanced by location-based services using Global
								Navigation Satellite Systems (GNNS) including Galileo, mean that
								users do not need to be GI expert or data analysts in order to
								link data, view the results and unlock insights. Everyone has
								the same opportunity to be entrepreneurial in his or her
								approach to new service ideas.</li>
							<li>Thirdly, the large online peer community supports each
								other, sharing innovation updates, skills and resources for the
								development of new service solutions.</li>
							<li>Lastly, OTN’s business mentoring consultancy helps
								translate innovative service ideas into reality.</li>

						<ol>
							<li>Data owners. Thanks to projects like OTN, GI and
								transport-related data owners understand the value that can be
								unlocked from their data when shared and combined/linked with
								other data streams. New GI and transport-related data is
								regularly opened to the Hubs, increasing the value of the
								ecosystem exponentially.</li>
							<li>Cities and Regions. Public Administrations use the Hubs
								to enhance their own operations, planning and decision making
								through creating linked data visualizations to generate
								insights. They use the community to source new service solutions
								and resources to increase the quality of life in the cities.</li>
							<li>Citizens and Businesses. SME’s use the Hubs to stimulate
								innovative thinking, test new ideas with the Community, and
								access business consultancy. They are engaged through the simple
								interface that enables them to play and have fun experimenting
								with data sets.</li>
							<li>Developers. Developers come to the OTN Hubs to have
								access to the raw materials they need to create new applications
								and services and to interact with the Cities, regions and SME’s
								who may commission or buy their innovations.</li>
