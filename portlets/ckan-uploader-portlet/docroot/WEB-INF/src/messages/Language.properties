OTN will try to transform excel sheets and csv files to geojson. <br /><br />Excel and CSV files should have column headers and the records should contain coordinates in two separate columns named 'latitude' and 'longitude'. Moreover, for excel file uploads, the system will try to transform data found in the first sheet which should be named 'sheet1'.)
